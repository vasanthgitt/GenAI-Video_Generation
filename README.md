# Video Generation Model

This project generates a video based on a text prompt. It uses a combination of Google's Generative AI for content creation, the BART model for summarization, Stable Diffusion for image generation, gTTS for text-to-speech, and MoviePy for video creation.


## Features

- Generate detailed content based on a text prompt.
- Summarize the generated content.
- Generate images for each summarized paragraph.
- Convert each paragraph into speech.
- Create a video clip for each paragraph with synchronized audio and subtitles.
- Concatenate individual clips into a final video.


## Requirement

- gradio==3.9.0
- transformers==4.19.2
- google-generativeai
- requests==2.27.1
- Pillow==9.1.0
- gtts==2.2.3
- moviepy==1.0.3
- textwrap3==0.9.2
